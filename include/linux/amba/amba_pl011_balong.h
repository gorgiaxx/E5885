 * This is a generic driver for ARM AMBA-type serial ports.  They
 * have a lot of 16550-like features, but are not register compatible.
 * Note that although they do have CTS, DCD and DSR inputs, they do
 * not have an RI input, nor do they have DTR or RTS outputs.  If
 * required, these have to be supplied via some other means (eg, GPIO)
 * and hooked into this driver.
